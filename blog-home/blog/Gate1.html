            <p id="about">
                Most students taking the gate exam hope to achieve a perfect score and a single digit rank in order to gain admission to India's elite colleges.
                My goal is to locate and excel in a field in which I wish to pursue further research. I enjoy the topics, so I want to put in the greatest effort possible to get into the college of my dreams.
                This is my goal, and I'd like to include you all in it.
            </p>

            <p>I'm excited to record and be accountable. Come along in this journey of mine!</p>

            <p>
                Exam is scheduled in February 2022 and I'm beginning the preparation in April 2021. I have A 9-5 job in testing domain which despite its heavy work schedule I intend to study along side with it.
                My plan is to introduce two-week sprints. I'll assess and share my success and failure scenarios by the conclusion of these two weeks, then improve them in the next sprints.
            </p>

            <p>
                I like to study but I realize my big mistake is not staying consistent so i rely on my short-term memory for exam preparation. So I understand the fears of not being able to recollect subjects after the exam is over. Now I am changing it.
                <ul>
                    <li>Retrospective Revision: Blank piece of paper, write down whatever you know about the subject </li>
                    <li>Active Recall: Just Recollect any topics </li>
                    <li>Spaced Repetition: Because my intention is to have a long term memory retention, i need to frequently recollect the subjects I have already studied.</li>
                    <li>Solve as many sums as I can get my hands-on: Since this is an exam I need to do this diligently. </li>
                    <li>Timeboxing, blocking time in calender for certain tasks</li>
                    <li>Most of my time should be spent analysing solved questions No-1 Rule</li>
                    <li>Animedoro Rocks!</li>
                    <li>Weekdays-Study & Weekends-Revise & Solve </li>
                    <li>When Tired, Practise Yoga Nidra + eyemasks</li>
                    <li>ParetoConcept - "It's a little hard wrap our heads around this concept, but it works" ~ 20% of content as 80% of the output</li>
                    <li>Write as many exams as you can get your hands on</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 id="Key-Takeaways">Key-Takeaways </h3>

            <p>
                Here we go, My instrospection after this commitment.<br />
                For six months, I had a detailed plan, and I learned all of my sections in the same way that I learned in school. I took on the challenge and chronicled my progress, but the end result was average passing grade.
                I had a goal set to find what I am interested in <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Engr Math: I am in good terms with this. Loving the Linear algebra visualization  </li>
                    <li>Data structure and Algorithm: Confident with the knowledge</li>
                    <li>Database: Interesting and easy</li>
                    <li>Computer Organization and Architecture: Appreciate it but I dont see myself contributing in this area</li>
                    <li>Digital Logic: I learn and forget, learn and forget.</li>
                    <li>Compiler Design: I enjoyed the whole idea and theories behind it.</li>
                    <li>Computer Network: Definitely more appreciation for OSI model</li>
                    <li>Theory of Computation: I appreciate Alan Turning contributons and I am interested in this</li>
                    <li>Graphy Theory: Learn and forget.</li>
                </ol>
                I would say I enjoy algorithm, compiler design and theory of computation the most.<br />
                I am focusing on taking the gate score of 420/1000 and converting it into an opportunity.

                <br /><br />
                      <strong>Would I encourage anyone to attempt Gate?</strong> <br />
                Recommended to prepare but please note its not just passing or getting a rank, strive for a better gate score. Score over Rank always. Any extra additional points with this would be to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Before any new journey in life, plan what is the outcome of your effort. Any gain at the end of the action.</li>
                    <li>Dont be overly emotional while preparing for an entrance exam. Emotions cause stress. </li>
                    <li>Dont compare your efforts with your chilled out life, dont feel proud and lose track of your efforts either</li>
                    <li>Stay neutral, Stay consistent with solving and analysing as much as possible and Stay focused</li>
                </ol>

                <strong> Now how will i proceed</strong>. <br />
                With this rank, I'll try to convert it into an opportunity. Know that:
                <br /> I have lived happy without the outcome of the exam, i can live normal having passed the exam. The point being: just learn everyday. That is really all you need done.
                <br /> I can afford optimism in such a situation because I learnt what I could. I have reached a certain maturity in studying.
                <br />
                As I was trying to get into a college in India with this score, that I realised there is such a thing as <strong>education maturity.</strong>
            </p>
            <br />
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Control your emotions while learning, examine in higher view of what you're learning, and relate what you've learned to concepts you already know aka mind mapping for a better memory. 
                This is education Maturity.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This blog is coming to a close, and my "definition of done" was to take this exam only in 2022, no more dedicated reattempts.<br />
                <br />
                I'm now focused on converting this gate score into an opportunity. I'm more forgiving of myself today than I was when I first started, grateful for the effort, and optimistic about the future.
